For this segmentation we trained the three axis because we were unable to train the direct 3D chuncks so we applied the slicing method.
We used Brats18 dataset for training the dataset.
After we train the three axis we will run the main file to obtain the results.For the main file to run we need the axis trained model otherwise it wont run.
